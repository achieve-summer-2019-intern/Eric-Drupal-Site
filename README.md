## My reflection on the theming week led by Sam Elayyoub

### What I learned this week:
- CSS tricks such as positioning of items on the z-axis
    - Using the z-index and position (relative vs absolute) to change the order of elements
- Indirectly learned how browsers handle scrolling as a result of the above
- Flex boxes, flex-wrapping, and displays such as flex, inline-flex, inline-blocks, etc.
    - How the tools above can be used to format the contents of a site
- How to create a new subtheme and edit an existing theme
- How to properly set up Drupal settings for a local machine
- How Bootstrap organizes content into columns
- Usage of percentages versus hard values (e.g pixels vs %)
- CSS selectors and how to better use a browser's inspector to make preliminary changes to a site
- How to address a class or id's child
- To focus on the elements of the page that I can quickly implement before spending excess time worrying about trying to implement some more convoluted features
- Some intro on twig and how to create a custom template
- How to deal with overflow, and how to create scroll bars

### What I accomplished this week:
- Emulated the general EverSport sports page, which in my case was the basketball page
- Learned a bunch about CSS from Sam, and from the other interns
- Refined my overall site through a better understanding of elements such as image styles, views, etc.
- Adopted a new mindset towards front-end design.
- Dipped my toes into editing the theme template

### What I would like to learn:
- Using JavaScript to touch up elements of the page such as the SuperFish drop-down menu
- More CSS advanced tricks to help design and create a more fluid site
- How to create a responsive website (for all elements)
- More hands on with twig, and using it to build a truly custom site

### How to run site:
```sh
    $ lando drush config-import
    $ lando start
```
Copy one of the four site links provided and paste into browser.
